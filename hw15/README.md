Homework 15
==========================
Game Pitches
--------------------------

For this assignment come up with three game ideas (by yourself) that you'd be willing to work on.  The games have to be written in python and pygame, but otherwise you are unconstrained.  They can be in realtime or turnbased, realistic or cartoony, serious or persuassive, etc. 

Focus on one good concept for a game that could feasibly be developed by two students of unknown or unequal skill level.  You will work on it until the end of the semester. This concept can be a moment of play, how it will feel, a game mechanic, etc.  Your project will then be implementing this one idea really well.  This means do not come up with ideas like "sims 3", more like "angry birds". 

> **NOTE:** your final game may be a proof-of-concept for a larger project.

Advanced students, you are not limited to the use of pygame if there is another library you want to use. We will work together to get whichever library you need working before the end of the semester on at least my laptop and the lab machines.

### How to do this homework...

Come up with an elevator pitch (one really descriptive sentence that takes about 15 seconds to say) for each concept.  Mention some similar games or a genre so we can get an idea how the game may look or play.  Then make a list of what you see as the elements involved in making this game.  Place them in this file with the format like the one bellow.  Then, simply turn in your ideas as "hw15".  We will send feedback and questions through github.

Before the end of break, as producers we will "score" the difficulty of each. Then we will green light the project we feel is most reasonable to implement in the time remaining in the course.  If you don't want to get stuck with your throw away idea, make sure you are willing to work on any of the three. You will then need to present this idea on Monday so make sure you flesh out the idea and what is involved.  Also, make a list of what you can bring to the table (art, level design, awesome code) to help find a partner.
